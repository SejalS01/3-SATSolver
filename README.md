# 3-SATSolver
# Netlist Generator
## Overview

This Python script generates a SPICE netlist based on the input matrix for CNF. It can be used for solving any 3-SAT problem containing at most 3 literals per clause. It is based on expanding the existing AC-SAT analog hardware solution. The script allows for the input, analysis, and netlist generation of a given set of clauses and variables, contributing significantly to the field of computational electronics.
