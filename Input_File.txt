# Example Input File for CNF Matrix
# The matrix represents the CNF: {A' + B' + C'}{D + E' + F'}{A + B + C}
# Each row represents a clause, and each column represents a variable where:
# 1 means the variable is present, -1 means the variable is negated
# 0 means the variable is absent.
# Matrix values (enter row by row, use space to separate values in a row):
# An example of the input written in the text file looks like this:
-1 -1 -1 0 0 0 
0 0 0 1 -1 -1
1 1 1 0 0 0

# Notes:
#  Ensure each line corresponds to one clause in your CNF formula.
#  This file format supports an arbitrary number of variables, but each line must 
#  have the same number of entries for consistency.
#  This format allows easy parsing and usage  
#  in simulations or solvers requiring CNF input.
